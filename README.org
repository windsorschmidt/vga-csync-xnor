* About

VGA H/V to Composite Sync Generator (XNOR).

| [[render_top.png?raw=true]] | [[render_bottom.png?raw=true]] |

Combines VGA horizontal and vertical synchronization signals into 75â„¦
composite sync for use with analog CRT displays such as PVMs/BVM's, or
televisions with RGBS inputs, e.g. SCART or RGB-modified televisions.

* EDID EEPROM

An on-board EEPROM allows the adapter to store and serve an EDID to
the host PC to automatically configure a TV-compatible video mode.

In Linux, [[https://github.com/ChalkElec/write-edid][write-edid]] may be used to program the on-board EEPROM with
an EDID. Sample EDID files have been included in the repository.
