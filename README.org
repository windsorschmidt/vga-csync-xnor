* EDID EEPROM

An on-board EEPROM allows the adapter to store and serve an EDID to
the host PC to automatically configure a TV-compatible video mode.

In Linux, [[https://github.com/ChalkElec/write-edid][write-edid]] may be used to program the EEPROM with an
EDID. Sample EDID files have been included.
